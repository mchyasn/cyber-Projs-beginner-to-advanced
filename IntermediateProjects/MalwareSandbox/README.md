# Malware Analysis Sandbox

This project sets up a basic malware analysis sandbox using Kali Linux in an isolated environment. It helps you safely analyze suspicious binaries through static and dynamic techniques.

Samples/       - Contains the malware or test samples  
Reports/       - Outputs of static analysis tools (file, strings, etc.)  
Logs/          - Results from dynamic analysis tools like strace and lsof  
Screenshots/   - Screenshots of analysis steps and outputs

Tools Used:  
- file: Identify the type of binary  
- strings: Extract printable strings from binaries  
- strace: Monitor system calls made by the binary  
- lsof: Show files opened by the running process  
- objdump, readelf: Binary inspection tools

Sample Commands:

file Samples/test_sample > Reports/fileinfo.txt  
strings Samples/test_sample > Reports/strings.txt  

strace -f -o Logs/strace.log ./Samples/test_sample  
lsof -c test_sample > Logs/open_files.log

Analysis Environment:

- Kali Linux (Virtual Machine)
- No Internet Access (use Host-only or Internal Network mode)
- Snapshots enabled for rollback
- Do not analyze real malware on your main system

Example Dummy Sample:

echo -e '#include <stdio.h>\nint main() { printf("Sandbox test\\n"); return 0; }' > test_sample.c  
gcc test_sample.c -o Samples/test_sample  
chmod +x Samples/test_sample
