# Practice Malware Obfuscation Techniques

This project demonstrates the application of basic malware obfuscation techniques using a harmless Python reverse shell payload. The goal is to explore how obfuscation affects detection, analysis, and functionality in a controlled, virtual Kali Linux environment.


## Tools Used

- Python 3
- Base64 (coreutils)
- Netcat (nc)
- Terminal-based file inspection

## Obfuscation Technique: Base64

### Steps Followed

1. Created a Python reverse shell script:
   - File: `samples/revshell.py`

2. Encoded it using Base64:
   ```bash
   base64 samples/revshell.py > obfuscated/revshell.b64
   ```

3. Decoded the obfuscated payload:
   ```bash
   base64 -d obfuscated/revshell.b64 > obfuscated/decoded_revshell.py
   ```

4. Tested execution:
   - Started a listener:
     ```bash
     nc -lvnp 4444
     ```
   - Ran the decoded file:
     ```bash
     python3 obfuscated/decoded_revshell.py
     ```

5. Result:
   - Connection established when listener was active
   - Reverse shell functionality preserved

## Analysis

- Base64 obfuscation hides code from casual inspection but is reversible.
- Useful for bypassing naive pattern matching or static scanners.
- Did not test against AV or YARA yet â€” to be implemented in future stages.

## Next Steps

- Add bytecode compilation and string obfuscation
- Evaluate detection using ClamAV/YARA
- Compare results of different techniques
