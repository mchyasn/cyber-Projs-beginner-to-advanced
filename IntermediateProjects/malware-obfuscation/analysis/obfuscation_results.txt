[Obfuscation Results: Base64]

Technique: Base64 Encoding
Original File: samples/revshell.py
Obfuscated File: obfuscated/revshell.b64
Decoded File: obfuscated/decoded_revshell.py

Execution Test:
- Decoded file executed using Python 3.
- Initial connection error due to no listener.
- Once netcat listener was started, reverse shell successfully established.

Detection Status:
- Not tested yet with ClamAV or YARA.
- File bypassed manual review unless decoded.

Conclusion:
- Base64 is a weak obfuscation method but can bypass basic static inspection.
- Easy to reverse engineer.
