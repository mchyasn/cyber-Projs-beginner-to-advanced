[Base64 Obfuscation]

Step 1: Original Python reverse shell created in samples/revshell.py

Step 2: Encoded the file using:
  $ base64 samples/revshell.py > obfuscated/revshell.b64

Step 3: Decoded the file using:
  $ base64 -d obfuscated/revshell.b64 > obfuscated/decoded_revshell.py

Step 4: Executed the decoded file:
  $ python3 obfuscated/decoded_revshell.py

Step 5: Received error "ConnectionRefusedError" due to no listener.
Fixed by starting netcat listener:
  $ nc -lvnp 4444

Result:
  - Reverse shell successfully connected when listener was active.
  - Functionality preserved after obfuscation.
