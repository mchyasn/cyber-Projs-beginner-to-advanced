==== External Call To User-Supplied Address ====
SWC ID: 107
Severity: Low
Contract: VulnerableBank
Function name: withdraw()
PC address: 422
Estimated Gas Usage: 7249 - 62193
A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
An external message call to an address specified by the caller is executed. Note that the callee account might contain arbitrary code and could re-enter any function within this contract. Reentering the contract in an intermediate state may lead to unexpected behaviour. Make sure that no state modifications are executed after this call and/or reentrancy guards are in place.

Initial State:

==== Transaction Order Dependence ====
SWC ID: 114
Severity: Medium
Contract: VulnerableBank
Function name: withdraw()
PC address: 422
Estimated Gas Usage: 7249 - 62193
The value of the call is dependent on balance or storage write
This can lead to race conditions. An attacker may be able to run a transaction after our transaction which can change the value of the call

Write to persistent state following external call
The contract account state is accessed after an external call to a user defined address. To prevent reentrancy issues, consider accessing the state only before the call, especially if the callee is untrusted. Alternatively, a reentrancy lock can be used to prevent untrusted callees from re-entering the contract in an intermediate state.
