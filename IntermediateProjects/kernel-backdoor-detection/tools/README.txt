This folder is reserved for advanced tools related to kernel backdoor detection.

Suggestions for future use:

- Custom or public LKM-based rootkits (e.g., Jynx2) for detection simulation
- Syscall inspection tools
- Kernel memory analysis binaries
- Extracted modules for manual inspection

Note: Always use in an isolated virtual lab environment.
