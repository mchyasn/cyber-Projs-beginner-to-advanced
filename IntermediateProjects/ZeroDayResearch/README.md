Zero-Day Vulnerability Research Lab
===================================

This lab simulates the methodology used by security researchers to identify, analyze, and document unknown (zero-day) software vulnerabilities in a controlled, ethical environment.

WARNING: This is a learning project. No real-world exploitation is performed.

Lab Goals
---------
- Understand how zero-days are discovered
- Use fuzzers and analysis tools (static and dynamic)
- Safely document and handle findings
- Build hands-on research skills for cybersecurity

└── tools.txt              # Installed tool list

Tools Used
----------
- afl++        – for fuzzing
- valgrind     – for memory analysis
- radare2      – for reverse engineering
- gdb          – for debugging crashes

Step-by-Step Guide
------------------

1. Create the folders:

   mkdir ZeroDayResearch && cd ZeroDayResearch
   mkdir fuzz_inputs logs screenshots
   touch README.md findings.md tools.txt

2. Install tools:

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install afl++ valgrind radare2 gdb

3. Create crashme.c:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    char buffer[100];
    if (argc > 1) {
        strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);  // Vulnerable
        printf("Received: %s\\n", buffer);
    } else {
        printf("No input.\\n");
    }
    return 0;
}

4. Compile with AFL++:

   afl-clang-fast -o crashme crashme.c

5. Create input:

   echo "test" > fuzz_inputs/sample.txt

6. Run AFL fuzzer:

   afl-fuzz -i fuzz_inputs -o logs -- ./crashme @@

7. Observe logs, crashes, and record:

   - logs/crashes/
   - Use gdb ./crashme logs/crashes/id:000001*
   - Document in findings.md

Secure Fix (Patch)
------------------

Replace in crashme.c:

    strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);

With:

    strncpy(buffer, argv[1], sizeof(buffer) - 1);
    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\\0';

Rebuild with:

    afl-clang-fast -o crashme_fixed crashme.c

Educational Value
-----------------
- Demonstrates how fuzzers discover unsafe code
- Practices binary triage and reverse engineering
- Builds strong portfolio content
