<h1>Reverse Engineering and Detection of Remote Access Trojans (RATs)</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
This project presents an in-depth analysis of Remote Access Trojans (RATs) through the application of reverse engineering methodologies, combining both static and dynamic analysis techniques. The approach incorporates behavioral monitoring, network traffic inspection, and the use of automated analysis tools and APIs to uncover the functionality and communication patterns of RAT malware.

As part of the detection and prevention strategy, the project involved crafting and deploying custom Intrusion Detection System (IDS) rules within a Snort-based firewall environment. These rules were specifically designed to detect and block Command-and-Control (C2) traffic, thereby preventing RATs from communicating with remote attackers and neutralizing the threat in real time.

The project demonstrates how integrating multiple analysis techniques‚Äîmanual and automated‚Äîcan significantly enhance real-time threat detection and active defense. By showcasing the practical deployment of IDS rules to both identify and block malicious activity, the work offers a replicable strategy to strengthen network defense mechanisms against advanced persistent threats.
