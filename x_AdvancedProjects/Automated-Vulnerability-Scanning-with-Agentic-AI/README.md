# Automated Vulnerability Scanning with Agentic AI

### This project demonstrates an automated vulnerability scanning system using an Agentic AI approach. The system consists of multiple AI agents that collaborate to strategize, generate commands, and execute scans based on the client's description, without the need for human intervention.

### Please note that this project serves as a rough proof of concept, and not everything might work seamlessly. It's important to keep in mind that commands or scripts that are interactive and require user input, such as msfconsole, may not function as intended within this framework.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, it is recommended to install the kali-linux-default metapackage, which includes a set of tools commonly used for penetration testing and vulnerability scanning. To install the metapackage, follow these steps:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y kali-linux-default
Or via kali-tweaks:
```
```
Run kali-tweaks

Go to Metapackages

Select kali-linux-default

Click Apply → OK

Enter your password if prompted
```

OpenAI API Requirement
This project requires an OpenAI API key. It currently uses the gpt-4-turbo model, but you may change it.
```
To get your key:

Sign up at OpenAI

Go to your API Keys

Click “Create new secret key”

Set it inside main.py → API_KEY
```

# OpenAI API usage may incur costs. Review pricing.

#⚠️ WARNING
```
This script will execute commands automatically without asking you.
You're trusting the commands suggested by the agent mchyasn0.
Use caution. You are responsible for all execution.

This project is designed for Linux.
```
Overview
The scanning process is automated through several cooperating AI agents:
```
Agent	Role
mchyasn0	Generates the initial strategy and provides input when needed
mchyasn1	Reviews strategies, command outputs, and the final report
mchyasn2	Handles errors and suggests fixes
mchyasn3	Monitors command output to detect if more input is needed
mchyasn5	Executes commands automatically
mchyasn4	Generates the final findings report
```
These agents communicate, provide feedback, and adapt their actions to ensure the client's requirements are fulfilled.

```
python main.py
The system will loop until mchyasn1 confirms that the client’s requirements are satisfied. Logs are saved in the Logs/ directory, and a report is generated as findings_report.md.

 Findings Report
findings_report.md includes a full vulnerability analysis created by mchyasn4.

Configuration
Modify main.py to set your scan target and description:

target_ip = "YOUR_TARGET_IP"
scan_description = "Scan for SSH vulnerabilities on port 22 using Nmap only"
Logging
Log files will be saved under Logs/, containing:
```
Command outputs

Agent feedback

Strategy iterations

Why Agentic AI?
This project adopts a multi-agent system using LLMs based on the following research insights:

Specialization
Agents focus on specific tasks: planning, execution, error handling, review, etc.
1 2

Collaboration
Agents communicate and refine solutions collaboratively.
1 3

Resilience
If one agent fails, others can compensate.
3

Scalability
Add more agents for new roles and tasks.

```
Realistic Problem Solving
Mirrors how human cybersecurity teams operate: strategists, exploiters, reviewers.
```
Multi-Agent vs Traditional Scanners
Feature	Agentic AI Project	Traditional Scanners
Multi-agent collaboration	✅ Yes	❌ No
Strategy refinement & adaptation	✅ Dynamic	❌ Static
Natural language understanding	✅ Accepts client descriptions	❌ Needs configs
Context-aware decision-making	✅ Yes, with feedback loops	❌ No
```
mchyasn1 continuously reviews the context and output, helping dynamically guide mchyasn0 to improve results.
