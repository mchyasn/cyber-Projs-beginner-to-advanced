#  Cybersecurity Projects: Beginner to Advanced

This repository contains a structured collection of **70+ hands-on cybersecurity projects** organized by difficulty â€” from foundational tools to advanced red/blue/purple team operations. Every project is designed, executed, and documented in real environments, not simulated tutorials.

---

##  Project Levels

Projects are grouped into three progressive levels:

- **Beginner Projects (1â€“25):**  
  Learn core skills through practical tools and concepts â€” scanning, encryption, authentication, honeypots, Snort, DNS spoofing, etc.

- **Intermediate Projects (26â€“50):**  
  Focus on threat detection, malware sandboxing, steganography, custom firewalls, rootkits, AI for intrusion detection, and SCADA security.

- **Advanced Projects (51â€“70):**  
  Build enterprise-grade tools and infrastructure: ransomware detection, zero-trust models, SIEM dashboards, SOC automation, blockchain analysis, and red vs blue team simulations.

##  Project Structure

Each project folder includes:

- `README.md` â€” Step-by-step walkthroughs and tool usage
- `screenshots/` â€” Visual evidence of execution
- `logs/`, `tools/`, `scans/` â€” Collected data and artifacts
- `findings.md` â€” Key results, notes, and lessons learned
- `setup.sh` (if applicable) â€” Environment initialization scripts

All folders follow a consistent format for reproducibility and portfolio value.

## Example Completed Projects

- `Internal-Recon/` â€” Network mapping and firewall analysis using Nmap  
- `Basic-Keylogger-(Linux)/` â€” Python keylogger using `pynput` in a safe VM  
- `Malware-Sandbox/` â€” Windows/Linux VM setup with monitoring tools  
- `Stego-Detection-Project/` â€” Covert data extraction using steghide, binwalk, exiftool  
- `SCADA-Security-Project/` â€” Modbus network simulation and vulnerability scanning  
- `Secure-Containers/` â€” Hardened Docker stack with Trivy CVE scans  
- `Firewall-Custom-iptables/` â€” Custom Linux firewall setup with logging

More projects are added continuously.

##  Requirements

- Virtualization tools (Proxmox, VMware, or VirtualBox)  
- Linux (Kali, Ubuntu, Fedora) and Windows (10/11, Server) VMs  
- Networking: VLANs, NAT, or bridged mode  
- Basic scripting: Bash, PowerShell, Python  
- Git and terminal usage
