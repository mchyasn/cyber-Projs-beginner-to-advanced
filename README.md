- Beginner Projects: Focused on foundational cybersecurity skills and hands-on tools.
- Intermediate Projects: Cover realistic scenarios, tool integration, and defensive/offensive security.
- Advanced Projects: Include enterprise-grade setups, automation, threat detection, malware analysis, and red vs blue simulations.

## Project Structure

Each project folder includes:

- A `README.md` with step-by-step instructions and explanations.
- Screenshots demonstrating each major step.
- Configuration files, scripts, or source code where applicable.
- Notes and learning outcomes.

## Completed Projects
